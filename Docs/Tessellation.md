Tessellation (Map Generator)
============================

# Introduction
This is a tessellation-based map generator. Pick a tessellation type, and use the many other options to transform it in many ways, and enjoy the unique challenge it brings.

# Options
## Tessellation Type
You can choose from a long list of different tessellation types as the basis of the map. It controls the basic texture of the map.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Squares | Hexagons | Square Y |

## Symmetry
In this mod, the term “symmetry” is used in a broad sense, and covers many different ways to make parts of the galaxy look like other parts of it.

## Galaxy Shape

## Outer Path
## Dissonance
## Connectivity

# Inspiration
This map generator is inspired by the following existing map types and options:

* **Grid**: the basis of everything else, and also the "crosshatch" option in particular.
* **GridEx** (from Dismiss's Generator): Aspect ratios, outline mode.
* **Honeycomb**: solar snake mode.
* **Maze**: minimally connected system, winding paths.
* **Mirrored**(from Dismiss's Generator) : symmetry.
* **Radiant's Map Generators**: beltway option, wibble slider.
